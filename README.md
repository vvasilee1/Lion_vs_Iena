#Image classification with fastai

FastAI is a layered API on top of Pytorch.This is a high level API that is good for experimentation and prototyping. 
You can achieve world class results with a few lines of code. It can be used for computer vision,nlp,collaborative
filtering and tabular data tasks. Achieving world ,class results was feasible with the extensive use of transfer learning,i.e.
pretrained models. This project is an image classification project that tries to predict whether an icon depicts a lion or an iena
